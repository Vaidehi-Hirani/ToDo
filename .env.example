# Backend Environment Variables (for Railway deployment)
# =====================================================
# Copy this file and set these environment variables in Railway dashboard

# JWT Configuration (REQUIRED)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-minimum-32-characters
JWT_ISSUER=ToDoApi
JWT_AUDIENCE=ToDoApiUsers

# Google OAuth (REQUIRED)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Database Connection (REQUIRED)
DATABASE_URL=Server=your-server;Database=ToDoDb;User Id=your-user;Password=your-password;TrustServerCertificate=True;

# Allowed CORS Origins (REQUIRED - comma-separated)
# Include your Vercel frontend URL
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:4200,https://to-do-sandy-zeta.vercel.app

# =====================================================
# Frontend Environment Variables (for Vercel deployment)
# =====================================================
# These should be set in Vercel dashboard or .env.local file

# API URL - Point to your Railway backend
# VITE_API_URL=https://todo-production-01ab.up.railway.app/api

# Google OAuth Client ID
# VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# =====================================================
# Local Development Setup
# =====================================================
# For local development:
# 1. Backend uses appsettings.Development.json (already configured)
# 2. Frontend uses environment.ts (should point to http://localhost:5000/api)
# 3. No need to set environment variables locally unless you want to override

# =====================================================
# Deployment Instructions
# =====================================================

# Railway (Backend):
# ------------------
# 1. Go to Railway dashboard -> Your project -> Variables
# 2. Add all environment variables listed above
# 3. Make sure DATABASE_URL points to your Railway PostgreSQL/SQL Server instance
# 4. Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS to include your Vercel app URL
# 5. Railway will automatically redeploy when you push to main branch

# Vercel (Frontend):
# ------------------
# 1. Go to Vercel dashboard -> Your project -> Settings -> Environment Variables
# 2. Add VITE_API_URL pointing to your Railway backend
# 3. Add VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID if needed
# 4. Vercel will automatically redeploy when you push to main branch

# =====================================================
# Security Notes
# =====================================================
# - NEVER commit .env files with real secrets to version control
# - Use strong, randomly generated JWT_SECRET_KEY (minimum 32 characters)
# - Keep different secrets for development, staging, and production
# - Rotate secrets periodically
# - Use Railway/Vercel's secret management features
